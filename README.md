# FlappyBirdVariant
 
This a a Flappy Bird variant meant that I'm doing to practice my knowledge and also learn new things along the way.

The things I learned from this are:

- AudioMixers
- Scriptable Objects
- Channel Events

Probably I will do other versions of this project in other branches, one for the same but using new tools like the New Input System, the UI Builder and maybe asyn/await instead of coroutines. The others will be different implementations of the project, one using Bolt and the other using Unity DOTS.
